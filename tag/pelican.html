                    <p>I converted Peerwire.de to <a href="http://getpelican.com" title="Pelican">Pelican</a>, a Python-powered blog generator, mainly
because I want to get rid of PHP where I can. Previously, this blog was running
on selfhosted Wordpress, which is quite powerful, but for my blogging needs
too complicated and oversized.</p>
<p>Pelican is a static site generator written in Python, which means I maintain a
directory on my server with a bunch of markdown files containing my posts and
whenever needed, Pelican regenerates the whole page to plain static HTML.
Given that I write maybe one post every week and regenerating takes about 3
seconds, I save a huge amount of processing power by providing static content
as opposed to dynamic content. And besides that, Wordpress is a mess to
administer, now I just pop up vim and start writing, we scrapped the search,
the spam-filled comments and several MBs of overcomplicated PHP.</p>
<p>In my eyes, PHP is sort of dead anyway. Which does not hinder anyone from using
or even continue developing it, but the concept is just from yesterday. Today,
we can use full-sized programming languages like Python (Django) and Ruby
(Rails) to easily develop and maintain complex web-applications with
centralized, managed configurations. Most of the work gets done by those
frameworks, so you can concentrate on actually developing something new.</p>
