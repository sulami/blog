* Dependencies

Requires a Haskell installation with ~stack~ for Hakyll (~brew install
haskell-stack~). Run ~stack setup~ to fetch to correct version of GHC.
The first compile will take a long time, an hour or so, as it compiles
Pandoc.

Requires a LaTeX installation (~brew cask install mactex~) to render
the CV PDF.

Requires a Racket installation (~brew cask install racket~) to process
metadata.

Other dependencies: make (BSD/GNU is fine), git, rsync.

* Usage

Build output to =_site= with ~make build~.

Live server available under https://localhost:8000 with ~make live~.

Deploy with ~make deploy~, which runs through a lengthy script to
change git branches and build fresh output. Make sure to commit on
=develop= first, pushing is optional. Will stash and unstash
uncommitted changes.
