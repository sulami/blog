A bit exhausted with technology, hence no meaningful updates to this site in a
few months. I have not programmed or tinkered much for fun in a few months.

Now that the weather has finally calmed down a bit, running is enjoyable again
and hopefully I can also get back to some rock climbing soon. This year's leg
injury is dragging on, as I'm not terribly good at keeping at my rehab routine.
Also trying to get some hiking & camping in before winter hits. Recently managed
to clear the last roadblocks to effective driving in Japan, namely acquired an
[ETC card][etc].

Making an effort to eat more and better, especially more fruit & vegetables.

After a holiday-induced lapse also back to keeping a low-effort Japanese study
habit, mainly Anki and TV.

Still playing Baldur's Gate 3 with a friend.
