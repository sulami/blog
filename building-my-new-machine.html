      <p>Right now I am planning my next main computer. While my current machine cost 
around 1500€ and is a water-cooled, black red hexa-core monster, it is not 
really optimized for what I am doing, which is mostly coding and compiling 
on Linux. Hal9k, what it has been called for many years now, has been 
incrementally build and does not feature any of it initial parts anymore 
(IIRC). It has been optimized for gaming on Windows, as this was what my 
younger self enjoyed the most. So it features only 8GB of RAM, because on 
Windows, you haven't needed more than this for the past decade, and one of 
the biggest graphics cards available, an overclocked Radeon HD7970.</p>
<p>Here are the problems:</p>
<p>I need more RAM. Linux likes to cache everything in
RAM, so even going up beyond 32GB of RAM can make sense, if you either
got enough to cache, or use ramdisks. Hell, 32GB of RAM can even be
enough to load your complete system root to RAM on boot (excluding your
/home-directory of course). RAM is always good on Linux.</p>
<p>The graphics card is horribly oversized for a
compositing window manager and occasional casual-gaming on Linux. Also,
open-source drivers for HD7xxx suck, like really suck, catalyst sucks
even more. Nvidia or Intel are the way to go right now.</p>
<p>It is huge. I am using a Cooler Master HAF932 case, which is a big tower, to 
fit my water cooling completely in the case. It even has wheels, so you can 
move this 60x60x25cmmonstrosity around. And it sucks up to 700 watts under 
load.</p>
<p>Here is what I plan to do:</p>
<p>Build a new machine, nearly from scratch, keeping only my harddrives for
obvious reasons. The specifics aren't worked out completely, yet, but it
will probably run either an Intel Haswell quad-, or an AMD Vishera
octo-core. I decided not to go for server-cpus for pricing reasons
without real benefits. Loads of RAM, probably 16-32GB, depending on what
deal I can make. And all fitted onto a micro-ATX mainboard and into a
neat little cube-case. The Vishera would receive a passively cooled
Nvidia GPU, as it does not feature an IGP.</p>
<p>If I get for HAL what I hope I can get, I even make profit switching, not 
even calculating the saved energy. If they would sell it for less than 
2000€, I would even consider a new Mac Pro (killing OSX, of course), but for 
it to be reasonable to me, they would have to drop the price by at least 
75%. So I build my hipster-machine myself.</p>
<p>One thing that is left after all, is choosing a new name. I figured, as HAL 
has will be completely sold, except two HDDs andone SSD, I cannot carry the 
name over. So I need to choose a new hostname for the new machine, which is 
also WIP right now. But there are some candidates:</p>
<p>DeepThought from Hitchiker's Guide (unfortunately, Linux does not allow
spaces in hostnames, so camelcase)</p>
<p>Shodan/Xerxes from System Shock</p>
<p>Deus from Shadowrun</p>
<p>LINC from Beneath a Steel Sky</p>
<p>Not in the list are GLaDOS for being to mainstream (that is even a
reason? wow... -.-) and the Deus Ex-AIs as they are to generic for my
taste. Also anything that does not directly refer to the computer I
thought of, like Fate or Aura.</p>
<p>I also sort of like Vger (or V'ger) from Star Trek, but the kernel
mailing list and stuff...</p>
<p>Right now, I am mostly leaning towards Shodan, as it is probably of the
most badass of those, and maybe the only one that can match HAL.</p>
<p>I will now continue to compare benchmarks and prices, like I did for the
last 4 hours. Take care.</p>
