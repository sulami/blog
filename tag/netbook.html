                    <p>I recently installed a fresh Fedora 20 on my trusty old HP Mini 110 netbook, a
cheap machine with a 1.66 GHz Intel Atom and 1 GB of RAM. I thought a lot about
which DE/WM to use. On one side, performance is key, and I mostly use it to
work in a shell, browse the web and read PDFs, so a tiling WM was my first
choice. I still chose the default Gnome 3 installation, as it provides a lot of
utility and is a slow but almost always working fallback, plus I get GDM.</p>
<p>I have used a lot of tiling WMs over the years, mainly i3, bspwm, dwm and
monsterwm (chronologically). While monsterwm is still my favourite for an
absolute riced machine, i3 and dwm are more usable without a great deal of
configuration when adding i3bar/i3status and dmenu. Because dwm is a lot faster
(although they are both pretty fast compared to anything else, we are talking
running complete systems on 30 MB of RAM, including the Kernel), I installed it
and used it for an evening to pull down the Kernel sources and set up my work
environment.</p>
<p>My first impression is pretty positive, it feels responsive and fast. I am
using dwb as my browser, urxvt as terminal emulator and wicd to setup WiFi,
which allows me to disable NetworkManager, which is think is pretty useless
anyway, I am not using it on any of my machines.</p>
