These days I work primarily on internal tooling, and there is a piece of wisdom
I think about alot, shared with me by my former colleague [Glen
Mailer](https://stainlessed.co.uk/):

> Make the right thing the easy thing to do.

What he meant was that the easiest and most obvious way of doing something
should be the right way, the way we want the thing to be done. This will be far
more effective than all other means of encouraging the same behaviour.

Glen would tell this story[^1] about a company that wanted the employees to
clock out when they would leave the office, but despite instructions employees
would often forget to do so. This is until a very clever office manager placed
the clock on the inside of the office door, making it hard to miss.

In practice that means rather than just documenting a best practice, or
otherwise asking for it, building your tooling to follow best practices by
default. Or maybe adding new tooling to replace a previously manual process.
Incidentally this could be considered the more applicable version of the
[default effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect).

In some cases you might be tempted to use the stick instead of the carrot and
try to prevent other practices altogether, but this comes at a cost.[^2]
Sometimes alternative approaches are valid and even required, and in those cases
users should be able to opt into these, if they understand the consequences of
doing so.

[^1]: The story aspect clearly worked, given that I still remember it several
    years later.

[^2]: Assuming you can even cover all alternatives, which is often questionable.
