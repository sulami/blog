#+title: Keyboardio Atreus Review
#+date: 2020-07-10

I recently received my early bird [[https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus][Keybardio Atreus]][fn:1] from [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/atreus/description][the
Kickstarter]] and have now been using it for about three weeks, so I am
writing a review for folks considering buying one after release.

Most of this is also outlined on the Atreus website, but here is the
short version: my colleague Phil Hagelberg designed [[http://atreus.technomancy.us/][the original
Atreus]] keyboard in 2014, and has been selling kits for self-assembly
ever since.

In 2019 Keyboardio, the company which created the [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/the-model-01-an-heirloom-grade-keyboard-for-seriou][Model 01]], got
together with Phil to build a pre-assembled commercial version of the
Atreus. Their Kickstarter ran earlier in 2020 and collected almost
$400k.

Phil's original 42-key version can be built with either a PCB or
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY2k75eWrLQ][completely hand-wired]], and uses a wooden, acrylic, or completely
custom (e.g. 3D-printed) case.

Keyboardio split the two larger thumb keys into two regular size keys,
bringing the total up to 44, and uses a PCB and Cherry MX-style
switches mounted on an Aluminium plate inside a black ABS case.

At a first impression, it is incredibly small[fn:2], noticeably
smaller still than the small [[https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english][Apple Magic Keyboard]]. At the same time,
it uses a regular key spacing, so once your hands are in place it does
not feel cramped at all. On the contrary, every time I use a different
keyboard now, I feel that half the keys are too far away to reach
comfortably. It is also flat enough that I can use it without a wrist
rest.

Mine has [[https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/3099/8088/files/CPG151101D213_Copper.pdf?11838687770053773851][Kailh Speed Copper]] switches, which require 40g of force to
actuate, with very early actuation points. They are somewhat
comparable to [[https://www.cherrymx.de/_Resources/Persistent/13618248706cd28e75ab9bdf9e55e9f8794611c1/EN_CHERRY_MX_BROWN.pdf][Cherry MX Browns]] without the dead travel before the
tactile bump. As mentioned above, the switches are mounted on an
aluminium plate, and can be swapped without disassembly.

The early actuation point of the switches does require some getting
used to, I keep experiencing some key chatter, especially on my weaker
fingers, though Jesse from Keyboardio is working hard on alleviating
that.

When it comes to noise, you can hear that it is a mechanical keyboard.
Even with relatively quiet switches, the open construction means that
the sound of the keys getting released is audible in most
environments. I would hesitate to bring it to a public space, like a
café or a co-working space. Open-office depends on the general noise
level, and how tolerant your coworkers are, I have not had anyone
complain about the sound level in video conferences.

The keycaps used are XDA-profile[fn:3] laser-engraved PBT of medium
thickness. Apparently there have been a lot of issues with the
durability of the labels, so the specifics of that might change. I
personally have had a single key start to fade a bit over 3 weeks of
use, but I do not actually care.

The keyboard is powered by the [[https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega32U4][ATmega32U4]], which is a pretty standard
controller for a keyboard, it is also used in the [[https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/][Teensy 2.0]] for
example.

I would judge the overall build quality as good. While it does not
feel like an ultra-premium product, there is nothing specific I can
actually complain about, no rough edges or manufacturing artefacts.

[fn:2] Dimensions taking from the product page: 24.3 × 10 × 2.8cm,
310g.

[fn:3] Symmetrical and the same height across the keyboard, like lower
profile SDA. That means you can rearrange them between rows.

Out of the box, the keyboard uses the open-source [[https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope][Kaleidoscope]]
firmware, which can be configured with the (also open-source)
[[https://github.com/keyboardio/Chrysalis][Chrysalis]] graphical configurator.[fn:4] Supposedly it is also possible
to use [[https://qmk.fm/][QMK]], and Phil has recently written [[https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/menelaus][Menelaus]], a firmware in
[[https://ryansuchocki.github.io/microscheme/][Microscheme]].

I have stuck with (pre-release versions of) Kaleidoscope so far, which
has worked out fairly well. Chrysalis is an Electron app, and doing
sweeping changes in it can be a bit cumbersome compared to using
text-based, declarative configuration, but it does the job. Flashing a
new version onto the keyboard only takes a few seconds. I also have to
mention the [[https://kaleidoscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][extensive documentation]] available. Kaleidoscope has a rich
plugin infrastructure, very little of which I actually use, but it
does seem to rival QMK in flexibility.

I am using the Atreus with [[https://colemak.com/][Colemak]], the same layout I have been using
for almost a decade now, and compared to trying the [[https://ergodox-ez.com/][Ergodox]],[fn:5] the
switching was much smoother. I am mostly back to my regular typing
speed of 80-90 WPM after three weeks, and I can still use a regular
staggered layout keyboard without trouble.

The modifier keys at the bottom are unusual, but work for me. I use
the three innermost keys with my thumbs, and the bottom edges by just
pushing down with my palm. It does require some careful arrangement to
avoid often having to press two modifiers on the same time at once.

With only 44 physical keys, the keyboard makes heavy use of layers,
which can be temporarily shifted to when holding a key, or switched to
permanently. By default the first extra layer has common special
characters on the left half, and a numpad on the right, which works
better than a regular keyboard for me.

The only problem I sometimes have is the lack of a status indicator.
This means I have to keep track of the keyboard state in my head when
switching layers. Not a big problem though.

[fn:5] When I tried using an Ergodox for the first time, the
ortholinear layout really threw me off, and I kept hitting right
in between keys.


* Conclusion

:END:

My conclusion is quite simple: if you are in the market for a keyboard
like this, this might be the keyboard for you. It does what it does
well, and is much cheaper than anything comparable that does not
require manual assembly. I personally enjoy the small form factor, the
flexible (set of) firmware, and the RSI-friendly layout.

I also want to highlight the truly amazing effort Keyboardio puts into
supporting their customers. You can browse the Kickstarter or their
GitHub projects to see how much effort they put into this, and I have
been in contact with Jesse myself while trying to debug a debouncing
issue in the firmware. I am very happy to support them with my wallet.
