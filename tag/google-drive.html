                    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not really into crypto (yet?) and everything I
write here is purely idealistic and probably somewhat unrealistic/stupid</p>
<h2>The current situation</h2>
<p>Some time ago, Facebook bought Whatsapp, which was my main way of
communicating using my phone. This event has made me think about where
the internet is heading in terms of privacy protection. Right now, I am
trying to figure out whether Chromium could be a better alternative to
Firefox, which is working worse and worse on Linux. I purposely do not
want to use Chrome as Google already uses their own search engine,
YouTube, Adsense, Analytics and Android/the Play Store, and maybe their
DNS-servers to track internet users from all around the world. Using
their partly proprietary browser which is known for phoning home is
obviously not the best idea.</p>
<p>But back to Whatsapp. There are some alternatives, some praising
encryption, like <a href="https://threema.ch/en/">Threema</a> or <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>. Threema is not free and as
Google does not utilize any payment method beside credit cards, only few
people will actually use it, and the only reason to switch to a
messenger is the userbase. I did not like Whatsapp in the first place,
but everyone used it, so I had to comply. Now I made the switch to
ecrypted (called "secure") Telegram messages with some of my closer
friends, but while it claims to be "open", this only means there is an
API. And if they sell out one day, say if Facebook or Google offer them
some millions, all their promises will be worth nothing.</p>
<p>Another big part of my concerns, before we come to my ideas for a bright
future, are email and VoIP. Email right now is de-facto unencrypted,
usually transmitted via SSL to the provider but that is it. The
providers usually provide for free and most of them probably scan the
conversations to sell the information and/or build user profiles
(*cough* Google *cough*). This can be partially solved by just
encrypting/signing emails via PGP, which right now only security nerds
and mafia bosses do. But handling keys is just not ready for the masses,
it basically should handle keys, en-/decrypt without the average user
even noticing. But the decentralized way emails are set up is already
quite good, although there are some really big providers, there is no
loss in using some small provider you trust or even using your own
domain and server.</p>
<p>VoIP is the real problem right now. I primarily use Skype, which is
owned by Microsoft since 2011. Skype is known to send all kind of data
to Redmond, and also allow crazy amounts of script languages for its
ads, which already resulted in some big security holes. Also the Linux
client sort of sucks. The interface is okay-ish, but the technical side
of things is not. But I do not blame Microsoft for this, I am happy for
the existence of a Linux client at all. So, Skype is bad, alternatives
are rare. Mumble is nice, but is centred around servers for gaming clans
and similar communities, using it as messenger is suboptimal. I also
tried Jabber, the VoIP-protocol with many features, which is actually
sort of great the way it is, but not end-user friendly enough.</p>
<h2>Solutions?</h2>
<p>What do I think would be the optimal way to handle this situations and
prevent some cyberpunk scenario in which Google, Facebook, Microsoft and
of course the NSA know everything about the average internet user?</p>
<p>First, we need to divide. I would keep email, as it is an easy and
already established way of exchanging information and data in a
mail-like fashion, which we will still need in the future. But we need
some way of enabling everyone to encrypt this mail. A simple choice
would be to establish a service that handles public keys and pairs them
to accounts. You then get a plugin for Outlook or Thunderbird that
connects to your account, generates a keypair, uploads the public
portion, gets the needed public keys of others and handles en- and
decryption of mails. The downside here would be a pretty big single
point of failure. If this service is down, or worse, gets hacked, all
the security is jeopardized. An idea would be to not store this
information on central servers but instead in a Bitcoin-like blockchain
which is shared by everyone. Which is probably generating enormous
amounts of traffic just to synchronize. Also, if no one uses ad-loaded
webinterfaces or provides unencrypted emails, how are the email
providers going to survive, and how are they going to justify
subsidizing the free email services? People will not pay for privacy,
which is the actual root of the problem.</p>
<p>Then we need a new multi-platform messenger, decentralized, encrypted,
capable of sending pictures, audio, video and of course live calls
including video and conferences. Basically Skype Premium, but without
central servers and more in a peer-to-peer fashion. Maybe just define a
protocol and write an open source reference implementation of a client.
I already thought about this a while, and most of this is
accomplishable, Skype already provides most of the functionality across
Windows, Mac, Linux and a lot of phones. There is the wonderful
Speex-codec which can be used for calls, video streaming should be no
problem either. As the content should be completely end-to-end
encrypted, compression would be sort of useless, so the generated
traffic will be more, but not by a lot.</p>
<p>But here comes the one problem I found rather quickly. You need to be
able to sync your private keys across devices. As I propose to just
develop a protocol without a central management, you cannot just enter
your username and password and get all your stuff from a server, because
that would mean, your private keys, which are not supposed to ever leave
your devices would be stored on the server. But I have come up with a
solution, at least I think so.</p>
<p>There will be some server structure involved, which will hold the
private keys, but in an encrypted form. When starting to use the
service, you generate your keypair. The public key gets into some sort
of public key infrastructure I yet have to figure out, maybe
blockchain-like, maybe not. The private key gets stored on the device,
protected by a password. A copy of it gets encrypted (say using
Rijndael/AES or Twofish) and can be stored on third-party servers. Those
third parties might enforce additional security measures via
accounts/passwords. If you want to use a second device with the same
identity, you can get you private key from said server, decrypt it and
import it. This way, you could basically store your encrypted key inside
Dropbox. I have to add, that this method relies on strong passwords more
than anything else, but maybe this will force sensible password policies
into the heads of the masses.</p>
<p>An addition I would make would be some sort of identifier-system,
comparable to DNS. No one wants to remember numbers or hashes to
identify people, and names are not unique to a person, so there should
be some way to (decentralized, of course) link a username or an address
with a keypair, which can be resolved easily. So if you want to send me
a message, you send it to "sulami", we resolve the name, get the public
key and are ready to start an encrypted conversation.</p>
<h2>Who will do it?</h2>
<p>This is the important question. I would like to work on something like
this, but obviously the scope is gigantic and there are experts needed
on crypto, network messaging, development for specific platforms,
interface designers, and the list goes on. If you read this and are
interested in starting such a project, do not hesitate to contact me,
someone has to make the first step. My public key is on the
contact-page...</p>
