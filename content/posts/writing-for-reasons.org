#+title: Writing for Reasons
#+date: 2020-11-08

This year, I have been writing more than even before over. In this
article, I would like to discuss some of the reasons for writing and
provide some thoughts on each.

* Writing to Remember

This is probably the most obvious reason to write for a lot of people.
Having written down a piece of information, you can come back later
and recall it. Historical context can be invaluable for decision
making, and often covers information that is not readily available
anymore.

The key here is being able to find notes later on. Paper-based ones
can be sorted by topic or chronologically, digital ones can be
searched for.[fn:1] Formats can be useful here too, for example by
supporting embedded code blocks or graphics.

[fn:1] As an aside, I find paper notebooks really clumsy in this
regard. They make a decent "staging area" to quickly capture
information, but are terrible to find anything in unless you take care
to maintain an index. Index cards can at least be reordered instead.

* Writing to Solve Problems

Early this year, before the pandemic hit Europe, I saw Paulus
Esterhazy's talk /[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7-2DW-KDV4&t=1429s][Angels Singing: Writing for Programmers]]/ at
[[https://clojured.de/][clojureD]]. It contained this great quote of Milton Friedman:

#+begin_quote
If you cannot state a proposition clearly and unambiguously, you do
not understand it.
#+end_quote

In [[https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/HammockDrivenDev.md][another talk]], Rich Hickey explained his notion of using notes as an
extension of his working memory:

#+begin_quote
So we have a problem, in general, because we're just being asked to
write software that's more and more complex as time goes by. And we
know there's a 7 +/- 2 sort of working memory limit and as smart as
any of us are, we all suffer from the same limit but the problems that
we are called upon to solve are much bigger than that. So what do we
do if we can't think the whole thing in our head at the same time? How
can we work on a problem with more than nine components. What I'm
going to recommend is that you write all the bits down.

[...]

But if we look at the 7 +/- 2 thing, we could say we can juggle seven
to nine balls but if you can imagine having an assistant who every now
and then can take one of those out and put a different color in and
you can juggle balls of 20 different colors at the same time as long
as there are only nine in the air at any one point in time. And that's
what you're doing, you're going to sort of look around at all these
pieces and shift arbitrary shapes of seven into your head at different
points in time.
#+end_quote

Writing everything down allows digging deep into details and going off
on tangents, and then returning to other aspects. As an added bonus,
these notes can be useful in the future as well, if archived properly.
I found [[https://orgmode.org/features.html][org-mode]] outlines incredibly powerful for this purpose, with
their foldable, tree-like structure that allows nesting sub-problems.

* Writing to Make Decisions

Writing is invaluable for decision making. Not only does it aid the
decision process (see above), it also allows returning to a decision
later and reviewing it.

[[https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record][Architecture decision records (ADRs)]] are a tool established just for
this purpose. The exact formats vary, and the details do not matter
too much, but here are a few key points I consider essential:

- The motivation for the decision
- The constraints involved
- The alternatives to consider and their respective tradeoffs

All of these are useful in several ways: they force you to acknowledge
the components of the decision, make it simple to get an opinion on
the matter from someone else, and also allow you to review the
(potentially bad) decision later on.

There is one more point: the conclusion. This is easy to forget,
because once a conclusion is reached, no one wants to spend time
writing it down. But if you do not write it down, the document does
not tell the whole story if reviewed in the future.

* Writing to Develop Ideas

This year I have seen a lot of people writing about SÃ¶nke Ahrens' [[https://takesmartnotes.com/][/How
to Take Smart Notes/]], which is about taking notes as a means to
develop long form writing. It popularised the idea of the
/Zettelkasten/, a physical or virtual box of notes which reference
each other to build an information network.

While I found the book quite interesting, I would not recommend it to
everyone due to the significant organisation overhead involved.[fn:2]

That being said, I believe that if you have a digital system which can
provide automatic back-links to avoid the exponentially growing amount
of manual maintenance required, there is little harm in linking
notes.[fn:3] At the very least it will make it easier to find a note,
and maybe it can aid the thinking process by exposing previously
unseen connections between concepts.

[fn:2] I think researchers and writers can gain a lot from this
method, but others not so much. Of course, if you want to read the
book, feel free to do so. It is an interesting read, and I wouldn't
call it overrated by any means.

[fn:3] [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam]], [[https://notion.so][Notion]], [[https://obsidian.md/][Obsidian]], and [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain][many others]] can do so.

* Writing to Communicate

This very article was written expressively to communicate information,
and as such required some extra work for it to be effective.

The most important factor when writing for communication is the target
audience. It dictates the format to use, and which prior knowledge can
be assumed. Maximising information density by being as concise as
possible is important to avoid wasting the reader's time.

As an added difficulty, when writing something to be published you
need to get it right the first time, there is no channel for
discussing follow-up questions. The old adage in writing is "writing
is rewriting", and I very much believe that to be true in this case.
Write an outline, then a first draft, then keep reading and revising
it until it is just right. Maybe show it to someone you trust for
feedback.

I personally also like to leave a draft and come back a few weeks
later. This way I always have a few drafts for new articles ready for
revision, until I feel that one is ready for publishing.
