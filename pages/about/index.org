#+TITLE: About

Hi, I'm Robin Schroer, a staff engineer with a personal blog.

On the [[https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes][Will Larson staff archetype chart]] I register mostly as
/Architect/ and/or /Solver/.

I have been enjoying high quality software engineering for a little
over a decade.

In the past I have worked on high traffic data streaming services and
distributed state machines as a service.

Even though I spent a lot of recent times professionally writing
Clojure, I'm currently excited about Rust.

If you are interested in working with me, here is my [[file:cv/index.org][CV]] ([[https://blog.sulami.xyz/pages/robin-schroer-cv.pdf][PDF]]).
