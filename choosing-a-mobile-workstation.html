      <h1>Update&nbsp;2014-10-30</h1>
<p>Peter Wu wrote me about this topic and sent me <a href="http://brianolsen.wordpress.com/2014/04/08/system-76-gazelle-professional-9-clevo-w650sz-short-review/">a review</a> of the System76
Gazelle, which raises concerns. A quick search for Galago reviews also resulted
in <a href="http://bitflip.net/system76-galago-ultrapro-review-clevo-w740su-259/">another quite negative review</a>. The System76 notebooks seem to be
mostly rebranded Clevo machines with questionable quality. That pretty much
leaves me with the Schenker ones as the only option, probably the B513. I will
write an extended review once I finalized my decision and got&nbsp;one.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Original Post&nbsp;2014-10-24</h1>
<p>I recently downsized from my huge Workstation that could draw up to one
kilowatt of power to a more compact and reasonable desktop cube with a current
generation Intel Xeon and loads of memory to cache whole directories and pieces
of software I use. It also solved my long problems with the <span class="caps">AMD</span> graphics
drivers for Linux by eliminating the dedicated <span class="caps">GPU</span> alltogether. The Intel <span class="caps">IGP</span>
is enough for desktop compositing simple&nbsp;3D-acceleration.</p>
<p>Now I am considering taking it one step further and transition to a notebook,
if I can get my hands on one that suits my needs. The reason for this is being
able to take my work environment with me, to work from wherever I am, do
presentations and have easy access to my data at all times, especially now that
I am finding myself more and more away from my desk. My desk would then consist
of my big 27&#8221; screen, my mechanical keyboard, a proper mouse and my sound
system, making the notebook just a smaller desktop that I can unplug and take
with me in a bagpack if I am leaving, making me a lot more&nbsp;flexible.</p>
<p>So, here are my requirements for a notebook like&nbsp;that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A screen between 13&#8221; and 15&#8221;, the best compromise between screen estate and
  overall size (to fit into a bagpack, which is a must, I travel on two wheels
  a&nbsp;lot)</li>
<li>1080p 16:9, to be able to use my and other screens and regular TVs without
  messing everything up by having to switch resolutions, or even aspect&nbsp;ratios</li>
<li>An Intel <span class="caps">IGP</span> without dedicated <span class="caps">GPU</span>, the drivers for Nvidia and <span class="caps">AMD</span> are by far
  worse and as noted above, I just need the <span class="caps">IGP</span>. Also improves runtime on&nbsp;battery</li>
<li>By that extension an Intel <span class="caps">CPU</span>, preferably current generation, ideally a
  quad core with Hyperthreading, but 4 threads should do fine as well (dual
  core + <span class="caps">HT</span> or vanilla quad&nbsp;core)</li>
<li>At least 8 <span class="caps">GB</span> of <span class="caps">DDR3</span> memory, preferably 1600+ MHz, I can use up to 32 <span class="caps">GB</span>
  fairly&nbsp;effectively</li>
<li><span class="caps">HDMI</span> and/or DisplayPort for connecting external screens, Headphone out, at
  least one <span class="caps">USB3</span>, at least 3-4 USBs in total, WiFi of course, 54+ MBit/s, Gb
  <span class="caps">LAN</span></li>
<li>I would prefer not having a numpad and a more normal sized keyboard instead,
  would not mind if it was&nbsp;backlit</li>
<li>I do not care about storage or optical drives, is already taken care&nbsp;of</li>
<li>A somewhat sturdy case would be&nbsp;nice</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the stability and hardware with excellent Linux support, Lenovo&#8217;s
Thinkpads are of course on my radar. Then there are the German Schenker
notebooks, which are affordable and customizable. Then there are System76,
which are known for distributing preinstalled Ubuntu machines. Here are some&nbsp;candidates:</p>
<h1>Lenovo ThinkPad T440s&nbsp;Ultrabook</h1>
<ul>
<li>14&#8221; 1080p <span class="caps">IPS</span>&nbsp;display</li>
<li>Intel i7-4600U (2.1 GHz dual core with <span class="caps">HT</span> = 4&nbsp;threads)</li>
<li>Intel <span class="caps">HD</span> Graphics&nbsp;4400</li>
<li>8 <span class="caps">GB</span> <span class="caps">DDR3</span>-1600&nbsp;memory</li>
<li>256 <span class="caps">GB</span> <span class="caps">SSD</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1287€</strong></p>
<p>This is the almost Thinkpad without a dedicated <span class="caps">GPU</span> and a 1080p display. While
it already features a nice <span class="caps">SSD</span>, the hardware is sub-par in comparison and the
price just not justified. I do not pay 50% extra for the pointing stick and the
Thinkpad casing, no matter how indestructible it is. Other candidates would be
the T540p, but that starts at about 1300€ as well (in configurations I deem&nbsp;useful).</p>
<h1>Schenker S403&nbsp;Ultrabook</h1>
<ul>
<li>14&#8221; 1080p <span class="caps">IPS</span>&nbsp;display</li>
<li>Intel i7-4500U (1.8 GHz dual core with <span class="caps">HT</span> = 4&nbsp;threads)</li>
<li>Intel <span class="caps">HD</span> Graphics&nbsp;4400</li>
<li>2950 mAh battery (about 8h&nbsp;runtime)</li>
<li>Without any&nbsp;drives</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>890€ (8 <span class="caps">GB</span>) / 920€ (16 <span class="caps">GB</span>)</strong></p>
<p>This is roughly a high-end 13&#8221; MacBook Air, not that MacBooks would even make
this list. They are nice hardware, but overpriced and sold by a terrible
company. It is less powerful than the B513 while costing more, which I can only
explain with the smaller case. The advertised runtime on battery is incredible
though, although that is not my main concern, I just need 3+&nbsp;hours.</p>
<h1>Schenker&nbsp;B513</h1>
<ul>
<li>15.6&#8221; 1080p <span class="caps">IPS</span>&nbsp;display</li>
<li>Intel i7-<span class="caps">4710MQ</span> (2.5GHz quad core with <span class="caps">HT</span> = 8&nbsp;threads)</li>
<li>Intel <span class="caps">HD</span> Graphics&nbsp;4600</li>
<li>5600 mAh battery (about 5h&nbsp;runtime)</li>
<li>Without any&nbsp;drives</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>769€ (8 <span class="caps">GB</span>) / 879€ (16 <span class="caps">GB</span>)</strong></p>
<p>The B513 looks really promising to me, relatively cheap, quite powerful for a
notebook and without anything I do not care about. The <span class="caps">IPS</span> panel is a tiny plus
for me. The extra power over the S403 comes at the cost of battery runtime, but
I can live with&nbsp;that.</p>
<h1>System76 Galago&nbsp;UltraPro</h1>
<ul>
<li>14.1&#8221; 1080p&nbsp;display</li>
<li>Intel i7-<span class="caps">4760HQ</span> (2.1 GHz quad core with <span class="caps">HT</span> = 8&nbsp;threads)</li>
<li>Intel Iris <span class="caps">IGP</span> (more powerful than Intel <span class="caps">HD</span>&nbsp;Graphics)</li>
<li>2800 mAh battery (about 4h&nbsp;runtime)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>880€ (8 <span class="caps">GB</span>) / 967€ (16 <span class="caps">GB</span>)</strong></p>
<p>The Galago is really powerful for a notebook this small, but expensive in
comparison. It has more power than the direct competitor S403 but only half the
battery runtime as a result of that. Both System76 notebooks get even more
expensive due to shipping and <span class="caps">VAT</span>, effectively adding about 20% to the&nbsp;price.</p>
<h1>System76 Gazelle&nbsp;Professional</h1>
<ul>
<li>15.6&#8221; 1080p&nbsp;display</li>
<li>Intel i7 quad cores with <span class="caps">HT</span> between 2.5 and 2.9 GHz = 8&nbsp;threads</li>
<li>Intel <span class="caps">HD</span> Graphics&nbsp;4600</li>
<li>3260 mAh battery (about 2h&nbsp;runtime)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>721€ (8 <span class="caps">GB</span>) / 808€ (16 <span class="caps">GB</span>) to 1050€ (8 <span class="caps">GB</span>) / 1137€ (16 <span class="caps">GB</span>)</strong></p>
<p>Like the Galago, the Gazelle gets more expensive thanks to the import to
Europe. It is roughly equivalent to the B513, but after <span class="caps">VAT</span> more expensive and
with the only battery in this list that I actually consider too&nbsp;small.</p>
<p>So here they are, my first candidates for a portable workspace. So far, it
looks like the Schenker B513 is clearly in lead, while actually being the
cheapest. It is more a classical notebook than a &#8220;modern&#8221; ultrabook, which
makes it cheaper overall, has all the features I desire, a matte <span class="caps">IPS</span> panel and
enough space to fit up to three 2.5&#8221; SSDs. For 860€ I can get the small quad
core with HyperThreading, which is enough, and 16 <span class="caps">GB</span> memory on this superb
platform. That is obviously more than I would pay for a desktop, which would
also enables me to switch parts for updgrades later, but the mobility is what
counts&nbsp;here.</p>
