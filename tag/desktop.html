                    <p>After I lost my SSD to the kraken and got a new one back, I set up a
completely new system. This time I decided to ditch both openSUSE and
Arch Linux and go with Fedora.</p>
<p>The reasons here are: I love Arch and pacman, but setting it up to a
degree where it does not need any major maintenance anymore (if this
ever happens) is a giant pain. OpenSUSE is quite nice as well, and YaST
is great, but the repos are sort of small and dealing with all the
user-supplied repos on OBS is just not bearable for a human being. Also,
KDE is nice but I had some problems with Kwin and I am not willing to
fix it.</p>
<p>So here we got Fedora: packages are reasonably up to date, it is close
to RHEL which is sort of useful for consistency, and Gnome is well
integrated.</p>
<p>You might have read the word "Gnome". Yep, that's right, I am actually
using Gnome 3. Using some of the extensions makes it quite usable, even
for someone like me, who has been using tiling WMs for almost two years
now (i3 -> bspwm -> monsterwm). This combination is set up and
configured to my likings within about 8-10 hours and is perfoming quite
well right now.</p>
