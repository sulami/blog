## 2014 -- 2015 » Co-Founder & DevOps @ Notdienste

In 2014 I got approached by a family friend to join in a startup around

over leadership of the core API framework, along with several supporting
services, leading a team of up to five developers. In late 2018 I decided to
move to Amsterdam and got permission to switch to a remote role. \newline

# Side Projects

Because I have been using UNIX-based operating systems for most of my life, and
I consider myself a power user, I have built some desktop software:

- [FrankenWM](https://github.com/sulami/frankenwm) Dynamic X11 tiling windowmanager (C/XCB)
- [Feed2Maildir](https://github.com/sulami/feed2maildir) Maildir-based feedreader (Python)
- [hmenu](https://github.com/sulami/hmenu) CLI fuzzy finder and launcher (Haskell)

When I was starting out I was interested in video games and considered a career
in the games industry, so I built a couple of projects in that space:

- [dgame](https://github.com/sulami/dgame) Rudimentary OpenGL 3D engine (D/SDL)
- [glow](https://github.com/sulami/glow) Advanced Pong (Haskell/OpenGL)
- [hGM](https://github.com/sulami/hgm) Web-based game master organisation tool (Haskell/Yesod)
- [textpy](https://github.com/sulami/textpy) Framework for text adventures (Python)

I have also for a long time been interested in networks and infrastructure, so a
built a lot of projects around this:

- [hcached](https://github.com/sulami/hcached) Memcached-compatible network hash table (Haskell)
- [Medusa](https://github.com/sulami/medusa) Nagios-compatible monitoring system (Python)
- [GoFuse](https://github.com/sulami/gofuse) Query circuit breaker (Go)
- [Nozdormu](https://github.com/sulami/nozdormu) Python benchmarking suite
- [Danketsu](https://github.com/sulami/danketsu) Microservice communication service (Go)
- [Elena](https://github.com/sulami/elena) Dynamic status API (Python/Flask)

As of 2018 I have decided to broaden my horizon, and have been working on an iOS
app which I have prototyped using [Clojurescript & React
Native](https://github.com/sulami/above-the-horizon), as well as
[Swift with Layout](https://github.com/sulami/above-the-horizon-layout).
