                    <p>I accidentaly wrote a <a href="https://github.com/sulami/frankenwm">window manager</a>. It started out by cloning <a href="https://github.com/cloudef/monsterwm-xcb">cloudef's
monsterwm-xcb</a> to apply some smaller fixes, maybe opening a pull request to
merge them upstream again. But I quickly found more and more things to fix,
then I started to add some smaller features I missed from other window
managers. And thus, FrankenWM was made, pieced together from monsterwm-xcb and
other window managers. I stole some of the ewmh-related code from <a href="https://github.com/venam/2bwm">2bwm</a>,
and adapted features from <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a>, <a href="http://i3wm.org">i3</a> and others. The name is an obvious
play on words.</p>
<p>So, what does it do? From a user's standpoint it is quite similar to dwm or
awesome (or of course monsterwm). It tiles dynamically, using one big master
window and a stack of smaller slave windows on each virtual desktop. There are
a few predefined layouts to choose from, v-stack, b-stack, grid, fibnonacci and
monocle. V-stack stacks the slave windows next to the master window, b-stack
below the master. Grid tries to give the same amount of screen space to every
window by placing them in a grid-like structure, fibonacci makes the each
window 50% as big as the window above it in the stack. And finally, monocle
fullscreens every window in a stacking fashion so you just see one at a time.</p>
<p>The preferred way of controlling it is by using the keyboard, which uses a set
of shortcuts similar to the ones known from vim by default, and makes heavy use
of the Mod4-/Meta-/Windows-key to prevent overlapping with shortcuts for other
software. The mouse can be used to control floating windows and to select
windows, but the focus lies on mouse-less usage.</p>
<p>There is also support for adding gaps between the windows, inspired by dwm's
useless gaps patch, which allow you to see your wallpaper or dropshadows from a
compositor. Those gaps are adjustable on the fly and optionally specific to
virtual desktops. I also implemented some features to allow using floating
windows without having to use the mouse. On the more technical side of things I
am currently implementing EWMH-compliance, which is important for compability
with a lot of different programs.</p>
<p>The configuration is entirely done at compile time by editing the config.h. In
my git repository I include a sample config with some comments explaining how
to use it. As an alternate example, you can have a look at <a href="https://github.com/sulami/dotfiles/blob/master/frankenwm.config.h">my personal
config</a>, which uses some more advanced features. As a bonus for Arch users,
I also maintain an <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/frankenwm-git/">AUR package</a> which I update on bigger changes in the git
repository, although I still reccomend using the version from Github, as I do
not have a lot of experience with the AUR.</p>
<p>The prerequisites for building FrankenWM are all XCB-based, specifically you
will need the XCB headers including the util, util-wm and keysyms ones, which
you can probably pull out of your distribution's repositories. I have yet to
build it on my OpenBSD machine, so I cannot say anything yet to building it on
the BSD family.</p>

                <p>I started using the HTML5-Player on YouTube, because Flash kept breaking
fullscreen, and I have not found a single video not supporting HTML5 in over a
month, so I would consider Flash-less YouTube a valid option. I also discovered
that Vimeo uses a pretty nice HTML5 player on their site ...</p>
