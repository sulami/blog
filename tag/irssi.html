                    <p>I love IRC. I try to keep all my common software on the shell in case I
somehow loose my ability to use X. This also enables me to use global
colorscheme and is performance-wise advantegous. There are many reasons
to live in the shell (aside from web-browsing, which is a pain), but
this is not the post to discuss them. Instead I want to make a quick
comparison of IRC-clients.</p>
<p>I admit, I have not used all that many IRC-clients over the years, as
they are usually indefinetely customizable and I tweak them for months
before I decide to move on to a different one to start from scratch.
Currently, I am using irssi, as I have not customized weechat to the
extend I would like to yet.</p>
<p>I prefer irssi as it is simpler and more unix-style, using just one
config, one theme and perl-extensions for every bit of bonus
functionality. Weechat works out of the box like a charm. It includes a
window-list which just has to be activated, automatic indentation of
nicks, a nicklist which just has to be disabled, colored nicks, a
trackbar and tons of more useful stuff. But the options are crap. It's
superior to the irssi djungle of formats, inside formats, inside other
formats, ... but in my opinion there are not enough ways to change
low-level stuff, weechat will always look like weechat, no matter what
you do.</p>
<p>But I promised the extreme version in the title of this post, this is
performance. On Twitch.tv, there is currently a stream called
'twitchplayspokemon', which is a pokemon hack that accepts button input
via twitch chat (which is irc). The corrosponding IRC-channel is used by
35k-38k people at a time, featuring tons of messages. It actually caused
problems with the Twitch servers, which could not handel the
concentrated load, but seems to run fine now.</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried using this channel with my IRC-clients. Weechat lags out
on joining, becoming unresponsive while building the nicklist, which is
hidden, but still active (this is what I mean by irssi is simpler).
Then, after about a minute, it works. Weechat uses 56.5 MB of RAM on my
system. That's insane. No fancy plugins, just one server, one channel,
smart-filter enabled, no nicklist.</p>
<p>Irssi works like on any smaller IRC-network, without any noticable
performance impact, using about 12 MB of RAM, which is more reasonable.
For comparison though, connecting through netcat uses 644 KB of RAM. Of
course, this is without logging, formatting or anything except just
printing what the server sends me, but for IRC, netcat is actually sort
of viable, in emergency cases.</p>
