title: Using Xephyr to Simulate Multiple Monitors
date: 2014-12-19

One of the most requested features in
[[https://github.com/sulami/frankenwm][FrankenWM]] is support for
multiple monitors. I currently only use one monitor, mostly because I do
not need more right now (there have been time where I have been using 4
monitors at the same time, all connected to one machine). This situation
makes it quite difficult for me to develop such a rather big feature,
simply because I cannot test it at all. I have tried to figure out how
to use nested X servers to simulate multiple monitors on a single screen
for a few weeks now, finally finding the solution today.

The nesting tool of my choice is
[[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Xephyr/][Xephyr]], because it
is quite feature-rich and easy to use (in comparison to Xnest). I have
also experimented with Xvfb and Xdmx, the latter being unable to use
randr, which is a dealbraker. But while scraping mailing lists today I
found the magical solution, and it only needs Xephyr.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  Xephyr -screen 640x480 -screen 640x480 +xinerama :1 &
#+END_SRC

This simple line starts Xephyr with two screens in one and uses
Xinerama, :1.0 and :1.1, if that makes any sense. The result looks
something like this:

Because I am currently working on the proper support, FrankenWM still
uses the whole screen as one, rather than using a separate desktop for
each monitor.
