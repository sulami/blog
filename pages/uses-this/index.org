#+TITLE: Robin Uses This
#+DATE: 2022-05-10

I really enjoy reading [[https://usesthis.com][uses this]] to get some ideas about what kind of
tooling other people use, and of course to borrow ideas, so I thought
I'd do my own version of this. This is also a page instead of a post,
and I will try to keep it up to date, as my setup keeps changing.

* Hardware

My workstation is optimised for portability, so everything is
relatively small and packs well for travel, while maximising
ergonomics:

- 2018 15" Apple MacBook Pro :: Got it for free, works
- [[https://www.therooststand.com/][Roost Laptop Stand]] :: Saves my neck and posture
- [[../../posts/atreus/][Keyboardio Atreus Keyboard]] :: Using the [[https://colemak.com][Colemak]] layout
- Apple Magic Trackpad :: Better for RSI (for me)
- [[https://europe.beyerdynamic.com/dt-990-pro.html][beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro]] :: Open-back, wired
- [[https://www.anker.com/products/variant/usb-c-hub,-7in1-usb-c-adapter/A83460A1][Anker 7-in-1 USB-C Hub]] :: Works well with the stand, and is the
  single thing to unplug when taking the computer away
- [[https://www.yubico.com/nl/product/yubikey-5c-nano/][Yubikey 5C Nano]] :: Has my GPG- and SSH-keys

* Software

Really just the current version of macOS, the [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-unstable/pkgs/applications/editors/emacs/macport.nix][MacPorts version]] of
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], and [[https://mozilla.org/en_US/firefox/developer/][Firefox Developer Edition]].

The specifics of my setup change a lot. I use [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] for most
writing, but otherwise I only use my email in Emacs, via [[https://notmuchmail.org/][notmuch]]. I
have been down the "do everything inside Emacs" road and decided that
there are too many rough edges for my taste, so I confine it to
text-processing related tasks.

All my configuration is [[https://github.com/sulami/dotfiles][available online]].

I always use a task-manager of some sort, currently [[https://culturedcode.com/things/][Things]], in the
past also org-mode, [[https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus][OmniFocus]], and [[https://www.2doapp.com/][2Do]].

I have also gotten pretty proficient at [[https://kicad.org][KiCad]] over the last few years.

* Lab

- [[https://www.siglenteu.com/digital-oscilloscopes/sds1000x-u/][Siglent SDS1104X-U]] :: 100MHz scope with amazing value. I sometimes
  wish I had the 1104X-E's much larger FFT, but otherwise there is not
  much on the market below [[eww:][~3000â‚¬]] that I would be interested in.
- [[https://www.rigolna.com/products/dc-power-loads/dp800/][Rigol DP832]] :: Linear bench power supply, fully upgraded. Complete
  overkill for what I am doing, but handy for audio work.
- [[https://brymen.eu/shop/bm235/][Brymen BM235]] :: Multimeter. Measures all the things, accurate, and
  robust. Sadly not the blue version.
- [[http://www.miniware.com.cn/product/ts80p-soldering-iron-more/][Miniware TS80P]] :: Running [[https://github.com/Ralim/IronOS/][IronOS]]. I used to have a [[https://www.weller-tools.com/we1010na/][Weller WE1010]],
  but lack of bench space meant I had to set it up every time. The
  TS80P does not feel weaker subjectively, perhaps due to the
  integrated heating element tips.
