      <p>Today I will write about something slightly different than usual. I will be
writing about a videogame, Homeworld. These days, Homeworld 1 and 2 are being
released in remastered editions, with support for current resolutions and so
on. This led me to playing the original. Homeworld 1 has been ported to Linux
by fans some years ago. All you need is an original game and access to a
Windows machine (or <span class="caps">VM</span>).</p>
<p>Install Homeworld on Windows, patch it to 1.05 and pack the complete game
directory to move it to your Linux machine. Then, mount the <span class="caps">CD</span>, get
<code>HW_Comp.vce</code> and <code>HW_Music.wxd</code> and put them in your game directory as well.
This enables you to play without the <span class="caps">CD</span> mounted. Then just get the prebuilt
binary for your <span class="caps">OS</span> (yes, <span class="caps">OSX</span> works as well) from [homeworldsdl.com][hwsdl] and
put it in the game directory as well (it is in <code>bin</code> in the .tar.gz). You might
also need to download some <span class="caps">SDL</span> libraries, but everything should be in your
distro&#8217;s repositories. If you have done everything right, you can start
Homeworld from the shell&nbsp;using:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">SDL_AUDIODRIVER</span><span class="o">=</span>alsa ./homeworld
</pre></div>


<p>If you experience sound issues under PulseAudio, make sure to install the
<span class="caps">ALSA</span>-plugin for PulseAudio. Using PulseAudio directly will result in glitchy
sound, so you have to proxy it through <span class="caps">ALSA</span>. Also reduce the ingame channels to
8 and the sound quality to&nbsp;low.</p>
<p>You can also start Homeworld on a separate X-Server (or in Xephyr) to preserve
your resolution (using the <span class="caps">DISPLAY</span> variable), but this might interfere with the
mouse in some cases. Instead, you can also use the parameter <code>/window</code> to open
it in windowed mode, which works pretty&nbsp;well.</p>
