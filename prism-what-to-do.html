</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>While following the recent international events, I (and probably
everyone else) heard about the NSA and Prism. Now I always distrusted
big companies, especially the ones from the US, because I know money and
power are everything over there. If they want to spy on you, they can.
Now there is <a href="http://prism-break.org/" title="Prism Break">something you can do</a>Â (read this, or this post will make
less sense) to at least limit the amount of information about yourself
getting to those people.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don't want to use Apple hardware (which I don't anyway,
but that is another story), as <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s15e01-humancentipad" title="South Park">Apple is infamous for invading user's
privacy</a>. Chrome OS is insecure, as Google makes money of ad
targeting, which is, you guessed it, gathering your information. And
Windows, well, who seriously trusts Microsoft? The alternatives listed
are a bunch of Linuxes and BSDs, although I think they are recommending
the wrong distros, beginners should try something like <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" title="Linux Mint">Mint</a>,
<a href="http://crunchbang.org/" title="Crunchbang">Crunchbang</a> or <a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/" title="openSUSE">openSUSE</a>.</p>
<p>The browsers are the same story, no Chrome, no Safari, no IE (as if
anyone would miss it), you don't know, what they are actually doing, and
while browsing, you give away an awful lot of personal data.
Technically, your browser could send you whole browsing history
(including "incognito mode", the only one saying nothing gets saved is
your browser), your Downloads, your login data and more to someone. The
right choices here are <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" title="Mozilla">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home" title="Chromium Project">Chromium</a> (which I guess is okay,
haven't read the source myself) and smaller browsers like <a href="http://surf.suckless.org/" title="suckless.org">surf</a> or
<a href="http://mason-larobina.github.io/luakit/" title="GitHub">luakit</a>.</p>
<p>The next interesting point is websearching. Again, Google is bad, who
knew? Yahoo and Bing, too. I'd say, use <a href="http://ddg.gg" title="DuckDuckGo">DuckDuckGo</a>. I use it as my
main search engine for some months now and prefer it over Google. While
Google sometimes gives me better results, most of the time, DDG does
good. Be sure to have a look at the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html" title="DuckDuckGo">bang commands</a>.</p>
<p>To make this a bit shorter, be careful, which email provider you use,
they can read everything you write and receive. Self-hosting is sadly no
real option here, unless you have access to a static IP and a TLD.
Cloud-storage providers can access all your files saved to them, you can
self-host using <a href="http://owncloud.org/" title="ownCloud">ownCloud</a> or <a href="http://seafile.com/en/home/" title="Seafile">Seafile</a>. Be careful what to enter on
any social networks, even if "private". You can either opt-out
completely or stay with the big ones (namely Facebook), as using a small
social network misses the point.</p>
<p>The instant messaging section is quite hard. Safe are IRC, <a href="http://pidgin.im/" title="Pidgin">Pidgin</a>,
<a href="https://crypto.cat/" title="Cryptocat">Cryptocat</a>, <a href="http://mumble.sourceforge.net/" title="Mumble">Mumble</a>, <a href="https://jitsi.org/" title="Jitsi">Jitsi</a>. Unsafe are all big desktop clients
(GTalk, Skype, MSN/Live Messenger, ...) and Whatsapp as well.</p>
<p>There are some more options for the guys with the tin foil hats, such as
using Tor permanently, only use end-to-end encrypted websites and
disable all scripts and plugins, then use custom DNS-servers and stuff
like this, but chances are, someone will see where you are browsing,
like the guy standing behind you.</p>
