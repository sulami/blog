      <p>So after I discussed the whole hardware situation for two or three days
with a good friend and did about 30 hours of research, I decided on a
specific set of hardware for my new Linux development workstation. <a href="/building-my-new-machine.html" title="Building my new machine">As I
mentioned earlier</a>, I wanted many cores/threads and loads of RAM,
while using some gpu with enough power for some simple 3D-applications
on open-source drivers, all tightly packed into a tiny desktop cube.</p>
<p>So I got myself an Intel Xeo E3-1245 v3, 4x 3.40GHz and Hyperthreading,
overclocking to be done, 16GB of DDR3-1600 CL9 RAM with the option to
upgrade to 32GB if needed/desired, and an ASRock micro-ATX board to hold
it.</p>
<p>My favourite cube-case, the Cooltek Coolcube Maxi was not available
anywhere, so I decided on a Bitfenix Phenom, which is basically the same
thing. The CPU-cooler will be a Zalman CNPS8900 Quiet, which is by far
the best low-profile cooling solution on the market, with the option to
upgrade to a Corsair H50/H70 or similar if needed, but I highly doubt
it. SSD and HDDs will be taken from HAL, my current machine, and the PSU
is some Zalman 500W I had on my shelf.</p>
<p>Alternatives discussed were a i5-4670 (no Hyperthreading), i7-4770 (more
expensive than the Xeon while less features) and an AMD FX-8350 in
combination with a Radeon HD6570 Silence (cheaper, but probably slower,
double the TDP of the Xeon). AMD APUs have superior graphics performance
but are way slower on CPU tasks. Opterons are not available for
affordable prices.</p>
