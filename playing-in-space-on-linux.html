</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>While I have been working day and night lately on my (sort of) new
project, peerwire.org (which currently links to this blog, but will soon
go live), I have now reached the beta phase which will mostly be
intensive testing and trying to break the site, as well as some minor
technical fixes. But this aside, I now have some spare time while I wait
for some other stuff to happen, so I decided to play a game.</p>
<p>I have not played a game for quite some time, if you do not count
playing for less than 10 minutes, I probably have not played a game this
year. As I do not have a Windows partition anymore (which I am quite
proud of, Linux and to some degree BSD achieve everything I need), I
only have my collection of right now 66 Steam games for Linux (out of
200 I own). Today I had another look at Kinetic Void, a kickstarted game
I picked up for 2.50â‚¬ when it hit Greenlight some time ago. It is still
in early alpha and not even close to feature-complete, but it is already
quite gorgeous if you like spaceships.</p>

<p>There are some other really cool games for Linux on Steam and most of
them are also rather cheap, but you can sink hundreds of hours into
some.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/" title="Steam">Kerbal Space Program</a></li>
</ul>
<p>More spaceships, more simulation. Pretty intensive on the hardware, my
high-end Intel CPU without dedicated GPU can barely run in, but it
works. Check the <a href="http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page" title="KSP Wiki">Wiki</a> for infos and how to learn the game, also
YouTube has some great tutorials.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sub/12985/" title="Steam">X3: Reunion, X3: Terran Conflict, X3: Albion Prelude</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have been playing the X-games since the first one, although I do not
own the latest one yet, as it seems to be the worst yet and I do not
really game anymore. 4X spaceship sandboxes with some story, huge
universe, top-notch graphics, really complicated and hard to get into.
But immense fun. If you start, get TC or AB, Reunion does lack some
important convenience features. The best resource I know of is
<a href="http://www.seizewell.de/" title="Seizewell">Seizewell</a>, which is German, as X comes from Germany and is played
there the most.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/" title="Steam">FTL: Faster Than Light</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a spaceship rogue-like, which means you select a ship, and start
on a journey to do whatever, until you either die or complete the story.
Than you start again. There are some well-made mods around to extend the
fun.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/107200/" title="Steam">Space Pirates and Zombies</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting space arcade action adventure game which really leads to
addiction.</p>
<p>There are some games for Linux that are more or less space-related I
have not tested yet, maybe someone can give me a tip on one of those:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/246090/" title="Steam">Spacebase DF-9</a></li>
<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/255500/" title="Steam">Entropy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/257930/" title="Steam">Race to Mars</a></li>
<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/212070/" title="Steam">Star Conflict</a></li>
<li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/233250/" title="Steam">Planetary Annihilation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As I hear, Star Citizen will also be on Linux, which will hopefully be a
great experience, maybe even a reason for me to install a GPU again. I
am also still waiting for Planetside 2 to come to Linux, which is really
fun with a bunch of friends (but also runs like shit)</p>
