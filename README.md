# Blog

This is my personal blog, generated as a static website.

The generation is done by a mostly custom [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) program
that uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as the input
format, with [TOML](https://toml.io) frontmatter, and
[Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) templates. It also includes a development
server with live-reload on file changes.

While some efforts have been made to make this generally useful, a lot of the
code is tailored towards my own needs.
