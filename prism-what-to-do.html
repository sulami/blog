      <p>While following the recent international events, I (and probably
everyone else) heard about the <span class="caps">NSA</span> and Prism. Now I always distrusted
big companies, especially the ones from the <span class="caps">US</span>, because I know money and
power are everything over there. If they want to spy on you, they can.
Now there is <a href="http://prism-break.org/">something you can do</a> (read this, or this post will make
less sense) to at least limit the amount of information about yourself
getting to those&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don&#8217;t want to use Apple hardware (which I don&#8217;t anyway,
but that is another story), as <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s15e01-humancentipad">Apple is infamous for invading user&#8217;s
privacy</a>. Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span> is insecure, as Google makes money of ad
targeting, which is, you guessed it, gathering your information. And
Windows, well, who seriously trusts Microsoft? The alternatives listed
are a bunch of Linuxes and BSDs, although I think they are recommending
the wrong distros, beginners should try something like <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Mint</a>,
<a href="http://crunchbang.org/">Crunchbang</a> or <a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/">openSUSE</a>.</p>
<p>The browsers are the same story, no Chrome, no Safari, no <span class="caps">IE</span> (as if
anyone would miss it), you don&#8217;t know, what they are actually doing, and
while browsing, you give away an awful lot of personal data.
Technically, your browser could send you whole browsing history
(including &#8220;incognito mode&#8221;, the only one saying nothing gets saved is
your browser), your Downloads, your login data and more to someone. The
right choices here are <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> (which I guess is okay,
haven&#8217;t read the source myself) and smaller browsers like <a href="http://surf.suckless.org/">surf</a> or
<a href="http://mason-larobina.github.io/luakit/">luakit</a>.</p>
<p>The next interesting point is websearching. Again, Google is bad, who
knew? Yahoo and Bing, too. I&#8217;d say, use <a href="http://ddg.gg">DuckDuckGo</a>. I use it as my
main search engine for some months now and prefer it over Google. While
Google sometimes gives me better results, most of the time, <span class="caps">DDG</span> does
good. Be sure to have a look at the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html">bang commands</a>.</p>
<p>To make this a bit shorter, be careful, which email provider you use,
they can read everything you write and receive. Self-hosting is sadly no
real option here, unless you have access to a static <span class="caps">IP</span> and a <span class="caps">TLD</span>.
Cloud-storage providers can access all your files saved to them, you can
self-host using <a href="http://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a> or <a href="http://seafile.com/en/home/">Seafile</a>. Be careful what to enter on
any social networks, even if &#8220;private&#8221;. You can either opt-out
completely or stay with the big ones (namely Facebook), as using a small
social network misses the&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>The instant messaging section is quite hard. Safe are <span class="caps">IRC</span>, <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>,
<a href="https://crypto.cat/">Cryptocat</a>, <a href="http://mumble.sourceforge.net/">Mumble</a>, <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a>. Unsafe are all big desktop clients
(GTalk, Skype, <span class="caps">MSN</span>/Live Messenger, &#8230;) and Whatsapp as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>There are some more options for the guys with the tin foil hats, such as
using Tor permanently, only use end-to-end encrypted websites and
disable all scripts and plugins, then use custom <span class="caps">DNS</span>-servers and stuff
like this, but chances are, someone will see where you are browsing,
like the guy standing behind&nbsp;you.</p>
