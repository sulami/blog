      <p><em>Disclaimer</em> In this post I link to some specific products. These links serve as
examples and are by no means direct reccomendations. Some of these are just the
result of a quick web search. If you decide to buy stuff, do your research,
figure out what exactly you need and choose a product based on&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>One of the most important things in your life is your health. As programmers,
and other professionals who mainly work at a desk, staying healthy can be
surprisingly difficult, even though sitting all day seems not particularly
demanding. Some of this risks can be avoided by consciously changing habits, but
often the right equipment can also play a big role. You really should not skimp
when it comes to maintaining your health. I will discuss some free, and also
some non-free ways that can help you with&nbsp;that.</p>
<h2>Repetitive Strain&nbsp;Injury</h2>
<p>There are several big health risks that programmers are affected by. The first
one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">repetitive strain injury</a>, which can happen to anyone and can
completely stop you from coding if it gets too bad. The easiest way of
preventing <span class="caps">RSI</span> is the right setup. You want your desk to be at the right height,
so your elbows are at a right angle. Depending on the keyboard, a wrist rest can
also be helpful. As a rule of thumb, if your hands or arms start hurting after
several minutes of continuous typing, there&#8217;s something&nbsp;wrong. </p>
<p>No matter what you do, doing things as unnatural as typing for long periods of
time is harmful to your body, like almost anything. So make sure to take regular
breaks, and also do some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmwqBMLVsjE">stretches</a> for your hands and&nbsp;arms.</p>
<p>You can also try using alternative keyboard layouts, although this is quite a
big step. I switched to using <a href="https://colemak.com/">colemak</a>, which is still relatively
close to <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>, on all my machines early this year, and it has helped me
tremendously, but it also took me about 10 weeks using it full-time to get back
to my own typing speed, and regain muscle memory for vim. Another popular
alternative is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">dvorak</a>, which is more widely supported (read: on
Windows without extra software), but radically differs from <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>.</p>
<p>If you want to go all out, there are also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Natural-Ergonomic-Keyboard-4000/dp/B000A6PPOK/">various</a> <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">kinds</a>
<a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-pc-us/">of</a> <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/collections/keyboards/products/ergodox-ez-keyboard">ergonomical</a> <a href="http://matias.ca/ergopro/pc/">keyboards</a>, which some people swear by.
I haven&#8217;t had any personal experience with these, but I feel like being able to
e.g. have your hands wider apart can make a big difference in your wrists,
especially if you are typing for 6-8 hours a&nbsp;day.</p>
<h2>Back&nbsp;problems</h2>
<p>Another problem many office workers have are posture and back problems, which
can lead to chronic pain. Make sure your whole working environment is set up in
a way that does not slowly kill&nbsp;you.</p>
<p><img alt="Proper posture illustration" src="http://www.metrophysicaltherapy.com/files/2014/02/workstation_426x418.jpg" /></p>
<p>A relativaly cheap solution I value very much are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Single-Monitor-Display-Mounting/dp/B00MIBN16O/">monitor arms</a>, which are
key to get both your monitor high enough to not to have look down at it and also
your desk low enough to not strain your elbows and wrists while typing. An added
bonus is the free space under the monitor. I personally prefer the desk mounted
ones for flexibility reasons, and they also allow you to run the cables behind
them, but wall mounting is also an option that can come in&nbsp;handy.</p>
<p>Another big part of your setup is your chair. Many office chairs are bad for
your posture and do not support your lower back properly, encouraging you to
lounge instead of sitting upright. Good chairs can be very expensive, the
<a href="http://www.kabseating.com/office/product.asp?product=204"><span class="caps">KAB</span> Executive</a> retails for way above $1000, but I&#8217;d go as far and say
it is worth that. I do not believe in saving money when it comes to my health.
Also it is going to last a decade or more without problems. But you might not
have this kind of money to spend on a chair, which I also fully understand. All
I want is to make you think about how you sit in your chair, especially for long
periods of intense&nbsp;concentration.</p>
<p>Another option can be a standing desk. There are many different ways of doing
things, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Height-Stand-Up-Desk-Monitor/dp/B00LNEB9KW/">fixed height standing desks</a>,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/LUXOR-Standup-CF48-DW-Stand-Crank-Adjustable/dp/B00PU6H5MA/">manually variable desks</a> and of course also
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electric-Stand-Up-Desk-Charcoal/dp/B00XLRJSAW/">electrically operated ones</a>. In addition to that, there are
also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/32-Wide-Standing-Desktop-Desk/dp/B015RXUV3U/">mini add-on desks</a> that you place on an existing desk. Standing
makes it easier to keep a proper posture (and also burns some additional
calories), but standing all day long is also bad for your back, so the proper
mix between sitting and standing is&nbsp;important.</p>
<p>There is one more point, and it is perhaps the most important one I have to
make: whatever you do, as an office worker on a desk, it is extremely important
to take regular breaks, get up (or sit down), stretch a bit, go for a short
walk. I would reccomend intervals of at most once per hour, better twice. This
is important for your cardiovascular system (i.e. your heart), and can also help
you think. Regular exercise of any kind is also something everyone should do. Go
to the gym, running or ride a bicyle. Do something that makes you sweat two or
three times a week, and your overall quality of life will&nbsp;skyrocket.</p>
