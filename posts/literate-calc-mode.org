#+title: Literate Calculations in Emacs
#+date: 2020-05-21

It is no secret that I am a big fan of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] for many
use cases. I think it is a great match for investigative or
exploratory notes, research, and [[https://github.com/sulami/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs/README.org][configuration]].

On a Friday evening about two weeks ago, my flatmate came up with an
idea for doing calculations in a literate way. Of course, if you
really wanted to, you could use a [[https://jupyter.org/try][Jupyter Notebook]], but we were
looking for something more lightweight, and ideally integrated into
Emacs.

A quick search came up empty, so on Saturday morning I got started
writing what came to be [[https://github.com/sulami/literate-calc-mode.el][Literate Calc Mode]]. The features I wanted
included named references to earlier results, spreadsheet-like
recalculations on every change, and the ability to save my
calculations to a file. And then of course the ability to interlace
calculations with explanatory text.

It was in part inspired by the iOS app [[http://tydligapp.com/][Tydlig]][fn:1], which also
provides calculations with automatically updating references to
earlier results, but does not allow saving the workspaces as files,
which I find very limiting.

But enough talk, this is what the result looks like in action:

#+html: <div class="figure">
#+html: <video controls proload="none" alt="Demo Video">
#+html: <source src="/raw/literate-calc-demo.webm" type="video/webm">
#+html: </video>
#+html: </div>

This is =literate-calc-minor-mode=, running alongside =org-mode=. As
you can see, it automatically picks up calculations and inserts the
results as overlays at the end of the line. It allows the user to bind
results to variables, which can even have names with spaces. Any
change causes all values to be recalculated, similar to a spreadsheet.

Because it uses Emacs' built-in ~calc-eval~ behind the scenes, it
supports almost everything =M-x calc= does, including formulas,
complex units, and unresolved mathematical variables.

Of course there are also other convenience functions, such as
evaluating just a single line, or inserting the results into the file
for sharing. I do have some more plans for the future, which are
outlined in the [[https://github.com/sulami/literate-calc-mode.el#roadmap][documentation]].

In addition to hopefully providing some value to other Emacs users,
this was also a great learning experience.[fn:2] I have learned a lot about
overlays in Emacs, and I published my first package on [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]], which
was a thoroughly pleasant experience.
