#+TITLE: About

I'm a Robin Schroer, a human, located on the third planet, Sol system,
Orion-Cygnus arm, Milky Way, Virgo supercluster.

Sometimes I produce sequences of characters that can be meaningfully
interpreted by humans and/or computers.

I've worked in exchange for money on some things you might have heard
of, such as [[https://circleci.com/][CircleCI]] or [[https://f1tv.formula1.com/][F1TV]] or [[https://player.bbc.com/en/][BBC Player]].

My planetary location changes somewhat frequently:

- Germany
- United Kingdom
- The Netherlands
- Japan (current)

Here are some of my interests:

- 3D printing
- Aeroplanes
- Books, especially non-fiction
- Chess, and board games in general
- Coffee
- Control systems
- Cooking, and sometimes baking
- Electronics
- Emacs
- Engineering
- Free software
- Hiking
- Language learning
- Old video games
- Puzzles
- Rock climbing
- Running
- Rust
- Science fiction, especially cyberpunk
- Space
- Sustainability
- Travel
