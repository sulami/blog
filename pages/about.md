title: About
---

I am Robin Schroer, also known as sulami. This is my blog, where I discuss
various topics, mostly related to software development, but occasionally also
others. I am a \*nix guy by heart and mainly write Python, Haskell, Elixir and
Clojure. I have been contributing to the Linux kernel as well as writing an X11
window manager and I generally like experimenting with code.

I also love puzzles/contests, so here are some I have completed:

- Project Euler 1–100 (And a bunch more)
- The Eudyptula Kernel Challenge
- The Matasano Crypto Challenges
- Hacktoberfest 2015–2017
- Advent of Code 2015-2017
- The Monad Challenges
- The Deadlock Empire

Apart from that, I am in the 94th percentile of Functional Languages on
HackerRank, using Haskell, and in the 95th honor percentile on CodeWars, using
mostly Haskell and Python. According to [keybr](keybr.com), my typing speed
(using Colemak) is in the 95th percentile with an average of 93 WPM.
