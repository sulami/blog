      <p>Almost every programmer knows what it means to get in the zone. That weird
feeling you get at two in the morning while working on a side-project, when the
the time flies by and suddenly all important features are done. Mastering the
zone is a crucial element of maximizing your productivity, but it can also be
quite&nbsp;difficult.</p>
<p>Because the being in the zone is a very fragile state, it is important to reduce
the risk of falling out of it. That means both preventing interruptions by
outside sources like coworkers (within reason) and playing your own <a href="http://mindingourway.com/not-yet-gods/">monkey
brain</a> to stay focused by reducing the possible distractions, like closing
all non-related&nbsp;windows/tabs.</p>
<p>These simple methods can work sometimes, but to <em>master</em> the zone and be able to
reliably enter it almost at will, a more sophisticated solution is needed, a
system. There are a great number of systems, and most of them are designed to
dictate a structure for planning work, so they can help take the last bit of
excess cognitive load off your mind, leaving you with just the next problem to
solve to think&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>One of the more simple systems is <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro</a>. Pomodoro in a nutshell is
dividing work into relatively small tasks, spend 25 minute intervals working on
these tasks and taking breaks in between. This approach forces you to focus on
the task at hand, making it easier to get in the flow. It is also a rather
simple system, you can read its Wikipedia page in two minutes and then start
using it, and the overhead is very small, which is why I like using it for most
of my&nbsp;coding.</p>
<p>If you have never used such a productivity system, I urge you to give Pomodoro
a try, there is not really anything to lose, and possibly a lot to gain. You
can also combine it relatively easily with larger-scale systems, like
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html">Agile</a> or <a href="http://scrummethodology.com/">Scrum</a>.</p>
